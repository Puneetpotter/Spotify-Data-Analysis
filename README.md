# Spotify_Data_Analysis
🎯 The Spotify data was taken from kaggle and use to analyze in different ways using python libraries.

🎯 The dataset contains different songs and their attributes such as release date, Singer's names, Popularity, Song's Durations, etc.

🎯 I have tried to analyze/visualize the dataset using different python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and seaborn as well as from statistical and graphical views.

🎯 The Dataset used is uploaded with the detailed analysis.
